# Digimon Scraper

Scraper for downloading Digimon images from http://digidb.io/digimon-list/.

Required Python modules are contained in `requirements.txt`:

    C:\digimon_scraper
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

This script attempts to make liberal use of `sleep()` to be respectful of the scraped website.
